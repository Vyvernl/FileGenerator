# FileGenerator
A Simple python script that creates a specific amount of files on your pc according to your desire.

## ⚠️ Risks ⚠️
### Space
- One file consists of 1kb, so a 100 of them would be 1mb and 1,000 of them would be 10mb, 100k files would be 1gb and so on.

### CPU
- Your CPU doesn't get smoked when the files are created the problem starts when you try to delete them.

### Getting in trouble at school

- Go to your terminal and use cd on the path you've saved the Python File.
- If the python file is called main.py all you have to do is
- Run
```
